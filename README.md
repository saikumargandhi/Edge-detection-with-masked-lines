# Edge-detection-with-masked-lines
<pre>
Edges are very important to identify the shape, size and depth of the object.
To detect the edges correctly we need to preprocess the image to remove any blurness and noise, enhance the image by sharpening.
After the preprocessing we can apply the Morphological transformations (Opening,Closing,Erosion,Dilation) based on the image requirements.
Now we apply Canny Edge Detection to identify the edges and color with any bright color which doesn't overlap with the colors present in the image.
Now the identified edges are stacked over the original image.
We have the original image with it's edges drawn over it using only Opencv and Python.
